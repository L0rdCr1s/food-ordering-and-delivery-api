# food-ordering-and-delivery-api
A java spring boot API, from which other software clients like mobile phones and web applications can use to create food ordering and delivery systems without worrying about backend implementation.

## cloning the project
clone the project and switch to development branch to see latest features.

## running the application
The application is still in initial development stages so you either build the jar file yourself and run it with java or you can open the project with intelij idea, and then run the project form there. To test the api you can use any api client. If you are using postman for api testing, the collection is provided (FOAD API.postman_collection.json), you can use that for testing.

## NOTE: Connection to real database is not implemented, data is stored using java collection classes, you shouldn't be surprised when your data gets deleted after server restarts.

## Contribution
Currently the api is still new, and i'm using this as an opportunity to explore java spring boot, so i won't accept any pull request until i'm ready, please don't make a pull request.
